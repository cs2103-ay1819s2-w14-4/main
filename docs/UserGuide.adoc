== Introduction

GradTrak is an application for NUS students to track their graduation progress without much fuss. It is currently only limited to courses offered in School of Computing. The primary method of input is Command Line Interface (CLI) which will benefit students of SoC because they generally type rather quickly. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `gradtrak.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`update`* : Update latest information about modules from CORS.
* **`add`**`m/CS2103T g/B-` : adds `CS2103T` into list of modules completed with a grade of B-.
* **`delete`**`n/1` : deletes the 1st module on the list of display all.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add m/MODULE_CODE`, `MODULE_CODE` is a parameter which can be used as `add m/CS2103T`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `m/MODULE_CODE [g/GRADE_OBTAINED]` can be used as `m/CS2103T g/B-` or as `m/CS2103T`.
====

=== View all other commands : `help`

Displays list of all available commands. +
Format: `help`

=== Set course of study: `set`

Set the course of study the user is undertaking +
Format: `set c/COURSE` +
If course requires specialisation or focus area, system will prompt user for further input.+

Course abbreviations are as follows:
****
* `BZA` - Business Analytics
* `CS` - Computer Science
* `CEG` - Computer Engineering
* 'IS` - Information System
* `IFS` - Infocomm Security
****

Examples:

* `set c/IFS` +
Sets course of study to Infocomm Security.

* `set c/CS` +
Sets course of study to Computer Science +

Since Computer Science requires Specialisation / Focused Area, +
system prompts user for further input to select choice of focus area: +
====
Please input the corresponding digit for desired focus area: +

.  Algorithms & Theory
.  Artificial Intelligence
.  Computer Graphics and Games
.  Computer Security
.  Database Systems
.  Multimedia Information Retrieval
.  Networking and Distributed Systems
.  Parallel Computing
.  Programming Languages
.  Software Engineering
====
User wants to choose focus area to be Artificial Intelligence so inputs `2`


=== Add modules completed and grades : `add`

Adds module based on module code. +
Format: `add m/MODULE_CODE [g/GRADE_OBTAINED]`

****
* Possible grade options are the standard letter grades (A+, A, A-, B+, B, B- etc.) and IC, EXE, CS, CU, W, S, U.
* Adding same module again but with different grades will update the grades obtained.
****

Examples:

* `add m/CS2103T` +
Adds CS2103T into list of modules completed.

* `add m/CS2103T g/B-` +
Adds CS2103T into list of modules completed with a grade of B-.

=== Delete modules : `delete`

Removes module based on module code. +
Format: `delete m/MODULE_CODE` or `delete n/number`

****
* Gives message if the module code of the module to be deleted is not found.
* Or delete based on position on display all position (see below).
****

Examples:

* `delete m/CS2103T` +
Deletes CS2103T from the list of modules completed.
* `delete n/1` +
Deletes the 1st module on the list of display all.

=== Display module information : `displaym`

3 options to display module information, e.g. course description, prerequisites and courses succeeding the modules. +
Format: `displaym o/OPTIONS [MORE_ARGUMENTS]`

=== Display user information : `displayu`

Displays various user information based on options and other arguments given +
Format: `displayu o/OPTIONS [MORE_ARGUMENTS]`
