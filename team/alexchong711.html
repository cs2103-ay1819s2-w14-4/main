<p>GradTrak is an application that was morphed from the codebase of <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4">Address Book - Level 4</a>.
It was conceptualised and designed in mind to assist students of NUS to track their graduation progress and plan future modules that they want to take.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major feature</strong>: added the ability for users to manage CAP and workload limits</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: allows the user to check if their current module plan for all semesters is aligned with their preferences.
The user can set their own preferences and check against the modules they plan to take.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why this feature: This is critical for users to ensure that they can manage their workload and maintain their targeted CAP for graduation.
It is easier for users to detect if any semester will be too challenging or too easy for them.
This may suggest reallocating some modules to distribute the difficulty more evenly across all semesters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This feature depends on many attributes that originally does not exist in the system and can only be implemented after implementing the other smaller features.
Before being able to check their plan against their preferences, the user must first be able to set their preferences, as well as estimate their workload and grades for each planned module.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: added the ability to shift the current semester when grades have been finalized. The current semester indicates that all modules taken in previous semesters have been completed and should be included in the calculation of the current CAP.</p>

<p>7: Some students have a target CAP they want for graduation
And may like to follow a CAP plan to ensure their cap remains at a suitable range at all times so that they can apply for SEP/NOC/or maintain their scholarship such that a suitable CAP is maintained for each semester</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>2: This could be achieved if there was a command that could tell them if their current plans are suitable in maintaining a preferred CAP for each semester</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>6:
Users would like to know what their current CAP is
(which is why we need allow them to set and pull out their current semester later)
Users would like to be able to estimate their minimum and maximum projected CAP based on their estimated grade range for each module
(which is why we need allow them to set and pull out their projected min/max grade for each semester)
Users would like to know if any semesters have modules that have too many difficult modules that would pull down their cap unexpectedly or too many easy modules that could be distributed to other semesters to lighten the stress over all semesters.
(which is why we need to allow them to set their limits)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>3: Since GradTrak is a command based application that has consolidated information about all the modules they plan to take,
1: users would like a single command to show them all the information they want to see about their CAP in one page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>8The cklimit command is implemented that takes in no arguments and allow users to run a cap analysis on their current module plan and generate the results to be printed into the browser panel</p>

<p>6: Users would like to know if any semester have modules that total up to too little or too much of a certain type of workload.</p>

<p>3: Each semester has 5 types of total workload hour ranges acceptable to the user to be checked against
Min max lec
Min max tut
Min max lab
Min max proj
Min max prep

<p>Alternatives:</p>

<p>Having a separate command to track cap with workload</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using the same command to track for cap and workload</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is more convenient for the user to only know 1 command that can tell them how well their current plan is aligned with their preferences. Since the limits for hour and cap are stored and used in similar ways, the same classes(Semlimit, json adapted sem limits) and command could be used to handle both types of limits. This could increase code readability and still allow for unique modifications in the future for each type of workload.
If they made any changes, they could view all the workload and cap analysis results changes with 1 command</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>7: Some students who do not have a strong programming background may be slightly uncomfortable taking multiple programming modules in year 1 as they may feel too stressed from huge weekly lab workloads. Other students who like project work may like to take 1 or 2 team-based modules per semester that focuses on communication skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>2: Students may have a preference for a limit on the workload amount to take for each semester. Various types of workload such as number of lecture hours, tutorial hours, lab hours, project hours, and preparation hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1: Students want the application to keep track of their preferences so that it is possible for gradtrak to help them detect if their current module plans fulfil their plan preferences</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>8The setlimit command(See:full description of the setlimit command)
Takes in the first argument without prefix as the semester to apply the set limits
Then takes in at least 1 argument that specifies which type of semester limit to set.

Displays a message to indicate success or error message.</p>
